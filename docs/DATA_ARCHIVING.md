Data Archiving Strategy
This document outlines a strategy for archiving historical data to maintain the performance and cost-effectiveness of the primary production database.

1. The Goal
The primary goal is to periodically move old, infrequently accessed data from the production database to a separate, long-term storage system. This keeps the production database lean and fast while ensuring historical data remains accessible if needed.

2. The Strategy
The most common approach is to create a scheduled job (e.g., a cron job) that runs a script to perform the "archive and purge" operation.

The process for a given table (e.g., orders, logs, user_activity) would be:

Identify Archivable Data: Define a policy for what constitutes "old" data. For example, any user activity records older than 18 months that belong to inactive users.

Copy to Archive: The script selects all rows matching the archive policy and copies them from the production database to a separate "cold storage" location. This could be:

A separate, cheaper PostgreSQL database optimized for large-scale storage.

A data warehouse like Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift.

Flat files (e.g., CSV or Parquet format) stored in a cloud storage bucket like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

Verify the Copy: Before deleting anything, the script must verify that the data was copied to the archive location successfully and is fully intact.

Purge from Production: Once the copy is verified, the script deletes the archived rows from the production database table.

3. Example Workflow (Archiving User Logs)
Let's say we want to archive user logs older than 2 years.

A scheduled script runs once a month.

SQL Query to select data:

SELECT * FROM user_logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

The script takes the result of this query and inserts it into an archived_user_logs table in a separate "archive" database.

After verifying the data integrity in the archive, it runs the delete command on the production database:

DELETE FROM user_logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';

This process ensures the production user_logs table remains at a manageable size, directly contributing to sustained application performance.
